			  <span title="The Taliban ,which refers to itself as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan  is a Deobandi Islamist religious-political movement and military organization in Afghanistan. It is currently one of two entities claiming to be the legitimate government of Afghanistan, alongside the internationally recognized Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.">Taliban</span> co-founder Mullah Baradar will lead a new Afghan government set to be announced shortly, sources in the Islamist group said on Friday, as its fighters battled forces loyal to the <span title="defeat thoroughly.">vanquished</span> republic in the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul.<br>
				The new government's most immediate priority, however, should be to <span title="avert or delay something bad or dangerous">stave off</span> the collapse of an economy<span title="engage in a close fight or struggle without weapons; wrestle.">grappling </span> with drought and the <span title="cause severe and extensive damage to.">ravages</span> of a conflict that killed an estimated 240,000 Afghans.<br>

				Baradar, who heads the Taliban's political office, will be joined by Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, the son of late Taliban co-founder Mullah Omar, and Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, in senior positions in the government, three sources said.<br>

				The US needs to closely watch China as it might try to take over the <span title="Bagram is a town and seat in Bagram District in Parwan Province of Afghanistan, about 60 kilometers north of the capital Kabul">Bagram</span> air force base in Afghanistan following the Taliban's takeover of the war-torn country and use Pakistan to get stronger to go against India, a former senior American diplomat has warned.
        America's former envoy to the United Nations <span title="Nimrata Nikki Haley is an American diplomat and politician who served as the 116th and first female Governor of South Carolina from 2011 to 2017, and as the 29th United States Ambassador to the United Nations for almost two years, from January 2017 to December 2018.">Nikki Haley</span> said President Joe Biden has lost the trust and confidence of American allies after his hasty decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. She said there are many challenges in front of the US.

        The US needs to make sure that Americans are protected and the country's cybersecurity is strong "because actors like Russia are going to continue to hack us because we show no signs of willingness to fight back," she said.

        "We need to watch China because I think you are going to see China make a move for Bagram Air Force Base. I think they are also making a move in Afghanistan and trying to use Pakistan to get stronger to go against India. So, we have got a lot of issues," she said.
